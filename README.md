# Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

It is my personal setup, the way I like it, with configurations, applications that are comfortable for me. Use it if you want as a template, as a guide. I will update it as I need to add new packages, configs...etc.

And yes... all my commits in this repo you will see that they are called **Wip** üòÄ

# Arch Linux installation

Just [R.T.F.M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)

The installation of Arch Linux has been carried out using [archinstall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/archinstall).
The [official installation page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) is also very complete, everything and that using archinstall is more comfortable and makes the process easier.

1. Download `ISO` file. https://archlinux.org/download/ (to download the torrent I use [`transmission`](https://transmissionbt.com/))
2. Take a pendrive and burn the ISO using, for example, https://etcher.balena.io/
3. Insert the pendrive into the new PC, modify the boot options to use the pendrive instead of the local disk.
4. If all goes well, you should see the distro prompt.

```bash
root@archiso ~ #
```

## Before installation using archinstall

Pre-flight checks üöÄ

### Connect to the internet

Once the usb is booted, connect the laptop to your local network (if not using ethernet cable).

```bash
iwctl station wlan0 get-networks # change wlan0 interface if needed. Type `$ ip a` if you don't know the name
iwctl station wlan0 connect SSID # put the SSID/BSSID with your corresponding local network
ping -c 1 1.1.1.1 # test connectivity
```

> [iwd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd) official documentation

### Start the installation

Run the following command:

```bash
$ archinstall
```

> In my case I use Netherlands as the closest country. Change it and use the one you need.

## After installation

First setps after installation. Remove the usb from your computer and restart. Grub will launch the new archlinux distro, and a basic prompt (black window) will appear. Enter your username and password.


### Connect the computer to the internet

```bash
$ sudo su -
$ nmcli device wifi list
$ nmcli device wifi connect SSID_or_BSSID password SSID/BSSID-PASSWORD
# or use
$ nmcli device wifi connect -a
$ ping -c 1 1.1.1.1 # check connectivity
$ history -c
$ exit
```

### Download dotfiles from git

```shell
$ cd /tmp
$ git clone https://github.com/containerscrew/dotfiles.git
```

# dotfiles installation

Now, is time to install all the necessary `dotfiles/packages/configurations`. I have decided to separate each part into a `.sh` file inside the `installers/` folder. There is also [a file](./installers//run_all.sh) that executes in order all at once. **I recommend to go step by step to understand what is going on.**

> [!WARNING]
> All the scripts must be executed inside the `repo root` folder.

**Remember, these packages many are necessary for the whole Qtile setup and others are custom that I use. Modify it to your needs**

## Packages

The distro comes with the defaults. Is time to install our custom packages. Please take a look to [installers/packages.sh](./installers/packages.sh).

Inside the folder `dotfiles`, where you cloned the repo, run:

```bash
$ ./installers/packages.sh
```

## Core config

Configurations about `networking`, `display managers` and more. Please take a look to [installers/core_config.sh](./installers/core_config.sh).

Run:

```bash
$ ./installers/core_config.sh
```

## User config

Configurations about `~/.config/`, `user permissions`, `mouse`, `shell` and more. Here is probably where you will need to change and adapt the configuration to your personal tools, configs... as you like. Please take a look to [installers/user_config.sh](./installers/user_config.sh).

Run:

```bash
$ ./installers/user_config.sh
```

## Run all

All in one:

```bash
$ ./installers/run_all.sh
```
